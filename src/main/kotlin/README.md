# Overview

I have never learned Java or Kotlin before, but I know Google just announced that Kotlin will be Google's preferred language for Android app development in 2019. Therefore, I decided to make a simple To-Do List app by using Kotlin to explore how it works. In this To-Do List app, users are allowed to add, remove, and display the task name and deadline in the To-Do List. This app also provides logic and functionality to make sure that users wouldn't enter the same task twice and prevent repetition and invalid input.
